    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      Spreading information from human to human plays a significant role in daily human life.  People spread information everyday.  Sometimes we spread information to specific people in our life and sometimes we make an announcementto a broader audience.  The spread of information can shape the public opinion (Galam, 2003) and therefore analyzing how information spread within a community is an interesting and actual topic in research.

    <h2>Goal of the project</h2>
      In this project we will look at the speed of information spread in different social network structures. Specifically, we will look at how quickly every person in the network knows about the rumour. A more detailed and precise definition of the network will be given in the next section. In this study we will not only look at how fast knowledge spreads within a social network, we will mainly look at the moment when second order common knowledge is achieved. Second order common knowledge can be seen as 'Everybody knows that everybody knows &phi;''.

    <h2>Details of the social network</h2>
      We define a social network to consist of N agents. Every agent is connected to at least 1 other agent and at most N-1 agents. Connections between agents are always bidirectional. The simulation starts with an injection of a rumour &phi; in a random agent (which we call agent 0). This happens at epoch 0. This means that after epoch 0, this agent knows &phi;. At epoch 1, agent 0 spreads the rumour to all its neighbors. Two agents are neighbors if they are connected. Not only does an agent spread &phi;, agents also spread the set of agents that know &phi; according to their belief. We call this set of agents M. This will be clarified in the example below.

    <h2>Example</h2>
      Consider a fully-connected social network with 4 agents. At epoch 0, a rumour &phi; is injected in the network at agent 1. At epoch 1, agent 1 spreads the rumour to agent 2, 3 and 4. Since agent 1 got the rumour injected, it does not know any other agents that know &phi;. Therefore M is empty. At epoch 2 all agents know &phi;. However, not all agents know that everyone knows &phi;. At epoch 2 three things happen:
      <ul>
          <li> Agent 2 spreads to agent 1, 3 and 4 &phi; and M = {agent 1, agent 2}
          <li> Agent 3 spreads to agent 1, 2 and 4 &phi; and M = {agent 1, agent 3}
          <li> Agent 4 spreads to agent 1, 2 and 3 &phi; and M = {agent 1, agent 4}
      </ul>
      After epoch 2 the knowledge of every agent is (duplications in the knowledge of agents are deleted):

      <ul>
          <li> Agent 1: &phi;, M = {agent 1, agent 2, agent 3, agent 4}
          <li> Agent 2: &phi;, M = {agent 1, agent 2, agent 3, agent 4}
          <li> Agent 3: &phi;, M = {agent 1, agent 2, agent 3, agent 4}
          <li> Agent 4: &phi;, M = {agent 1, agent 2, agent 3, agent 4}
      </ul>

      This means that every agent knows &phi; and every agent knows that every agent knows &phi;. In theory we could infinitely repeat this process in order to achieve common knowledge. However, this is not possible to model. Therefore we chose to stop at second order common knowledge.

    <h2>Measurements</h2>
      As previously mentioned we want to measure how quickly rumour &phi; spreads and when second order common knowledge is achieved. For the final project we want to compare different social network initializations with each other. More specifically, we want to look at the number of epochs needed for second order common knowledge for different social network initializations.
